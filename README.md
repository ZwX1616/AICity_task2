TF implementation:



log:


 20190402: MobileNet 224x224x3 with cosine loss, use half training set, lr=0.1, train FC only, 1000 iter - no convergence
 
 
 20190403: MobileNet 224x224x3 with 0/1 CE loss, use full training set, lr=0.01, train full model, 1000 iter - CE~0.6
 
 may need preprocessing or loss function mod
